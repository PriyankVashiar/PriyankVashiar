### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer with little to no experience. Just started programming professionaly but have a knack for logic and a spirit to keep trying to find the solution.
I have interest in many things and have tried this and that in custom recovery for phones to machine learning. Though work keeps busy and therefore no time for these hobbies.
